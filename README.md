# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction System

This project analyzes and predicts student academic performance using basic **AI/ML techniques**.  
It was developed as a **mini project** during **Semester 5 (2024)** for the **Artificial Intelligence** course at **SRM Institute of Science and Technology**.

---

## 🧠 Core Idea

The system aims to evaluate and forecast student outcomes based on academic scores, attendance, and behavioral data.  
This helps identify students who may require early support or intervention to improve academic success.

## 📊 Features

- Accepts input features like subject marks, attendance, and internal scores  
- Uses AI-based logic to predict student performance categories  
- Can be scaled to include ML models like decision trees and logistic regression  

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Integrate machine learning models using `scikit-learn`  
- Visualize trends using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`  
- Add GUI for user-friendly data input and result display

## 🛠 How to Run (Planned Setup)

> After adding code to `/src`

```bash
# (Optional) Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

# Run the prediction script
python src/predict.py
```
